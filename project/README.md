## Project Description

The goal of this project is to acquire, clean, analyze, and model real-estate transaction data for Dublin.  
The analysis will use public datasets:

- **CSO HPM04 - Market-based Household Purchases of Residential Dwellings**  
  This dataset provides detailed transaction data for residential property purchases across Ireland, including Eircode/zipcode information which enables precise geographic analysis of Dublin's real estate market. The data includes breakdowns by dwelling type, purchaser type, and location.

The final result is a **Jupyter Notebook** including data acquisition, analysis, modeling, and visualizations.
