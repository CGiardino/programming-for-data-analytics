# Health Insurance Risk Classifier – Project Plan

The project is structured over a 5-week timeline as follows:

### Week 1: Data Setup, Cleaning & Preprocessing
1. Review and Load the dataset
2. Define the risk-classification target (low / medium / high)
3. Clean the data (handle types, normalize numeric features, encode categorical)
4. Create an SQLite database and store the cleaned dataset
5. Run simple SQL queries to confirm correct storage and retrieval

### Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Load data from SQLite into pandas
2. Plot distributions (age, BMI, charges, risk classes)
3. Examine correlations
4. Summarize key findings

### Week 3: Neural Network Model
1. Split data into training and test sets
2. Build and train a neural-network classifier using TensorFlow/Keras
3. Validate and tune hyperparameters

### Week 4: Model Evaluation
1. Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
2. Analyze confusion matrix
3. Address class imbalance issues

### Week 5: Final Review & Submission
1. Re-run all analyses for consistency
2. Improve formatting and clarity
3. Review references
4. Final commit and submission

## Deliverable
A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook including data acquisition, analysis, modeling, and visualizations.
